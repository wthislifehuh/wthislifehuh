# My PROPER Introduction

✨ Let’s start properly—

it all began ding-dong when I was a little kid, watching my dad, the engineering wizard, solve complex piles of problems with deadly ease. His passion for engineering was contagious (𝘭𝘪𝘬𝘦, 𝘴𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘰𝘶𝘴𝘭𝘺, 𝘋𝘢𝘥, 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘴𝘩𝘰𝘶𝘭𝘥’𝘷𝘦 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘯 𝘢 𝘮𝘢𝘴𝘬). One day, he showed me how to write a simple program, and boom—I was hooked. The ability to create something out of nothing with just a few lines of code? Pretty much my first love. 💻❤️

Hi all! I’m Joe Ee, part-time 𝘀𝗻𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗵𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗮𝘀𝘁🍧, part-time 𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗿👩‍💻, and 𝐟𝐮𝐥𝐥-𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐝𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐫. ☁️

I’m currently a 𝗬𝟯𝗦𝟯 (𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝘀𝗲𝗺𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿) student at 𝐔𝐓𝐀𝐑, pursuing a 𝐁𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐫 𝐨𝐟 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐮𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐒𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞. I’m passionate about turning ideas into software applications and designs that don’t just look good but actually work good (𝘺𝘦𝘴, 𝘐’𝘮 𝘭𝘰𝘰𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘢𝘵 𝘺𝘰𝘶, 𝘣𝘶𝘨𝘨𝘺 𝘤𝘰𝘥𝘦). I’m always eager to learn and explore new technologies so that 𝗱𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗺𝘀 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗯𝗲 𝗯𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗲𝗱 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗻𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀. I continuously push myself to develop both my soft skills and hard skills (and my patience for debugging). Open to new challenges, I’m dedicated to making meaningful contributions in a professional environment. 💕
