## ✨ My PROPER Introduction

it all began ding-dong when I was a little kid, watching my dad, the engineering wizard, solve complex piles of problems with deadly ease. His passion for engineering was contagious (*seriously, Dad, you should’ve worn a mask*). One day, he showed me how to write a simple program, and boom—I was hooked. The ability to create something out of nothing with just a few lines of code? Pretty much my first love. 💻❤️

Hi all! I’m Joe Ee, part-time **snack enthusiast** 🍧, part-time **code tinkerer** 👩‍💻, and full-time **dreamer** ☁️

I’m currently a **Y3S3 (final semester) student at UTAR**, pursuing a **Bachelor of Computer Science**. I’m passionate about turning ideas into software applications and designs that don’t just look good but actually work well (*yes, I’m looking at you, buggy code*). I’m always eager to learn and explore new technologies so that **dreams can be burned into plans and realities**. I continuously push myself to develop both my soft skills and hard skills (and my patience for debugging). Open to new challenges, I’m dedicated to making meaningful contributions in a professional environment. 💕

If you’re looking for a motivated and enthusiastic person who’s eager to learn, grow, and contribute to your team, I’d be delighted to explore potential opportunities.
